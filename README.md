# Rat in a Maze Visualizer

Welcome to the Rat in a Maze Visualizer! This project is a web-based visualization tool to demonstrate the Rat in a Maze problem, a classic backtracking algorithm problem where the rat needs to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://your-demo-url.com).

## Features

- Interactive maze creation
- Step-by-step visualization of the algorithm
- Different maze sizes and complexity
- Highlighting the path taken by the rat
- Ability to reset and try different paths

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rat-in-a-maze-visualizer.git
   cd rat-in-a-maze-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Open the application**
   Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Create a maze**
   Use the grid to create walls by clicking on the cells. Define the start and end points for the rat.

3. **Run the visualization**
   Click on the "Start" button to see the rat finding its way through the maze. You can step through the algorithm or let it run automatically.

4. **Reset and try different configurations**
   Use the "Reset" button to clear the maze and try different configurations and complexities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute:
